# e-nose-dataset-for-quality-control-of-Coffee-beans

This is an exploratory data analysis of the publicly available dataset that is associated with the paper of Rodríguez, J., Durán, C., & Reyes, A. (2009). Electronic nose for quality control of Colombian coffee through the detection of defects in “Cup Tests”. Sensors, 10(1), 36-46.

The dataset comparts of 3 folders that include samples of 10 Average quality Coffee beans, 20 High quality beans and 28 of Low quality. Each sample is recorded for 300 time points using an A-nose device using different types of sensors ( e.g. SP-12A,SP-31,TGS-813,TGS-842,SP-AQ3,GS-823,ST-31,TGS-800).

Unfortunately, the dataset is poorly explained and registrated and eventually i decided to not put too much effort in this since i am just trying to get acquainted with enose data at the moment :).
